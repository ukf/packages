# `ukf/packages`

This repository acts as a package registry for the other
UK federation projects hosted on GitHub. A single package
registry is used so that consumers do not need to add
a repository reference for each dependency used.

This repository is public; you can download packages freely
using the GitHub user interface even if not logged in.
However, note that GitHub requires that use of the package
registry from tools such as Maven is authenticated. This is
normally done by using a Personal Access Token with the
`read:packages`Â scope.

For Maven, include a `<repository>` definition like this in
your project's POM:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>ukf-packages</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/ukf/packages</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

To use a Personal Access Token to provide authentication
for a Maven build, include it in your `~/.m2/settings.xml`
like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.2.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.2.0
        http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.2.0.xsd">

    <servers>

        <server>
            <id>ukf-packages</id>
            <username>your-github-username</username>
            <password>your-personal-access-token</password>
        </server>

    </servers>

</settings>
```

To provide authentication for a CI job using GitHub Actions,
you can build an appropriate `settings.xml` file with an
action like this:

```yaml
    - name: Set up Maven
      uses: s4u/maven-settings-action@v2.8.0
      with:
        servers: |
          [{
              "id": "ukf-packages",
              "username": "${{ github.actor }}",
              "password": "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          }]
```
