# `ukf/packages`

This repository acts as a package registry for the other
UK federation projects hosted on GitHub. A single package
registry is used so that consumers do not need to add
a repository reference for each dependency used.

Note that although this repository is public, and that you
can download packages freely using the GitHub user interface
even if not logged in, GitHub requires that use of the package
registry from tools such as Maven requires authentication
through a Personal Access Token.
