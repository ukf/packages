# `ukf/packages`

This repository acts as a package registry for the other
UK federation projects hosted on GitHub. A single package
registry is used so that consumers do not need to add
a repository reference for each dependency used.

This repository is public; you can download packages freely
using the GitHub user interface even if not logged in.
However, note that GitHub requires that use of the package
registry from tools such as Maven is authenticated. This is
normally done by using a Personal Access Token with the
`read:packages`Â scope.
